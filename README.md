www/customize.cssrallax Scrolling for Cocos2d-X 2.x

This code is 100% based on the [CCParallaxScrollingNode project for
cocos2d-iphone](https://github.com/aramkocharyan/cocos2d).

[Jason Marziani](https://github.com/jasonmarziani/CCParallaxScrollNode)
ported it to Cocos2d-X, but the project is not compatible with Cocos2d-X
2.x, so I forked and modified.

------------------------------------------------------

#### To test:

Run the included project in XCode 4.

#### To use

Include the following files in your project

    CCParallaxScrollNode.h
    CCParallaxScrollNode.cpp
    CCParallaxScrollOffset.h
    CCParallaxScrollOffset.cpp
